Hiya, This bot was developed by [@Cloud-121](https://github.com/Cloud-121). I designed this bot to help discord servers with users in multiple timezones to know each others time and be able to say there time simply without having to pull up a unix clock. 
This bot is completely free and open source on my github [here](https://github.com/Cloud-121/Vipper-Timekeeping-discord-bot).
A few commands you can use are:

`/registertimezone [timezone or currenttime]` - Register your timezone

`/whatsthetime [user]` - Show your current time in your registered timezone

`/whatismytimezone` - Show your current registered timezone

`/help` - Show a help message
