# Vipper Timekeeping Discord Bot

Hiya, This bot was developed by [@Cloud-121](https://github.com/Cloud-121). I designed this bot to help discord servers with users in multiple timezones to know each others time and be able to say there time simply without having to pull up a unix clock. 

This bot is completely free and open source on my github.

## A few commands you can use are:

`/registertimezone [timezone or currenttime]` - Register your timezone

`/whatsthetime [user]` - Show your current time in your registered timezone

`/whatismytimezone` - Show your current registered timezone

`/setusertimezone [user] [timezone]` - Set another user's timezone only if you have admin permissions

`/version` - Show the bot's version that's currently running

`/help` - Show this help message (Look you found this one :3)
