# Vipper Timekeeping Discord Bot

Hiya! This bot was developed by [@Cloud-121](https://github.com/Cloud-121). I designed this bot to help Discord servers with users in multiple timezones, so they can know each other's time and easily share their own without needing to pull up a Unix clock.

This bot is completely free and open-source. You can check it out on my GitHub: [Vipper Timekeeping Discord Bot](https://github.com/Cloud-121/Vipper-Timekeeping-discord-bot).

## Commands

Here are a few commands you can use:

- `/registertimezone [timezone or currenttime]` - Register your timezone.
- `/whatsthetime [user]` - Show your current time in your registered timezone.
- `/whatismytimezone` - Show your current registered timezone.
- `/version` - Show the bot's version that's currently running.
- `/help` - Show this help message (Look, you found this one! :3).

## How to Use

### Register Timezone
Use the `/registertimezone` command to register your timezone. You can provide a specific timezone or the current time in your local timezone. If you don't know your timezone, the bot can help you find it based on your current time.

### Show Current Time
To show your current time in your registered timezone, use the `/whatsthetime` command. You can also query the time of other users by specifying their name as an argument.

### Show Your Timezone
Use the `/whatismytimezone` command to display your currently registered timezone.

### Show Bot Version
Use the `/version` command to display the current version of the bot.
