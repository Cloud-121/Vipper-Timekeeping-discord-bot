# Vipper Timekeeping Discord Bot  

Hey there! This bot was created by [@Cloud-121](https://github.com/Cloud-121) to make it easier for Discord servers with members in different time zones to keep track of each other's local times. No need to pull up a Unix clock—just send a time, and the bot will automatically format it into a Discord timestamp!  

It's completely free and open source on GitHub.  

## Commands:  

- `/registertimezone [timezone or current time]` – Set your timezone  
- `/whatsthetime [user]` – Show the current time for a registered user  
- `/whatismytimezone` – Display your registered timezone  
- `/setusertimezone [user] [timezone]` – Admins can set another user’s timezone  
- `/version` – Show the bot’s current version  
- `/help` – Display this help message (You found it! :3)
