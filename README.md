# Vipper Timekeeping Discord Bot

Hiya! This bot was developed by [@Cloud-121](https://github.com/Cloud-121). I designed this bot to help Discord servers with users in multiple timezones, so they can know each other's time and easily share their own without needing to pull up a Unix clock.

This bot is completely free and open-source.

## Commands

Here are a few commands you can use:

- `/registertimezone [timezone or currenttime]` - Register your timezone.
- `/whatsthetime [user]` - Show your current time in your registered timezone.
- `/whatismytimezone` - Show your current registered timezone.
- `/version` - Show the bot's version that's currently running.
- `/help` - Show this help message (Look, you found this one! :3).
